# remembering-to-test

I wrote some [code](https://github.com/peterwdj/football-teams) to create two randomised teams for our weekly five-a-side matches, but I forgot to write any tests. As a result, Ed asked me to write out 100 times that I should always write tests first when writing code. This should work.
